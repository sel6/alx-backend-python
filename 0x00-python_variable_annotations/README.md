# 0x00. Python - Variable Annotations
***
#Type annotations serve the following purpose:

* Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.

* Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
